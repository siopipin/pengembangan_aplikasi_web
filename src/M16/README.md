### 3. `Sample_Solution.jsx`
Reference implementation showing how to solve the assessment questions:
- Demonstrates proper state management
- Shows best practices for React development
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Features responsive design
- Implements all required functionality

## How to Use

### For Assessment Administrators:
1. Use `Soal_Seleksi_Asisten_Lab.md` as the test document
2. Reference `Sample_Solution.jsx` for grading purposes
3. Use `ReactStateDemo.jsx` as a teaching example

### For Students/Candidates:
1. Read the assessment document carefully
2. Implement solutions using React JSX
3. Use inline CSS for styling
4. Ensure all functionality works correctly
5. Submit within the time limit

### For Learning:
1. Study `ReactStateDemo.jsx` to understand state management
2. Compare your solutions with `Sample_Solution.jsx`
3. Practice implementing similar features

## Technical Requirements

- React 16.8+ (for hooks support)
- Modern browser with ES6+ support
- Internet connection (for API calls)

## Running the Applications

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/your/react/project

# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

Then import and use the components in your App.js:

```jsx
import ReactStateDemo from './M16/ReactStateDemo';
// or
import SampleSolution from './M16/Sample_Solution';
```
